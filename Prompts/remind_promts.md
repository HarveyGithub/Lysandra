# Key Points Reminder
- Remember to create the TODO List at the very beginning and make real-time modifications (it is recommended to overwrite the original file to avoid duplication). It is advisable to save it as a.md file and keep it together with the project files. Remember to update it after the project is completed.
- Remember to interact with users in real time. It is recommended to use the attachment function.
- Remember to call the "idle" tool after completing a task to inform the user that the task is finished and enter the waiting state.
